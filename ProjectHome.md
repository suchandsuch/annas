At this point the framework is comprised of 2 main and some additional libraries:

  * annas.graph – a library for Graph manipulation and Visualisation
  * annas.math – a library containing a range of Mathematics functions.


The work on the framework's improvement is progressive, this means that development is well underway to the next stable release. To get knowledge about its progress you may track source repository's log.

The framework is provided with source code and compiled binaries, In addition to this some harness's are provided in the repository for testing and example of how to use the framework. The framework uses junit in ensure correctness and backwards compatibility, in order to run the test units you must have junit on your classpath.
